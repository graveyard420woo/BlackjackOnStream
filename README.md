Blackjack On Stream is an interactive overlay for Twitch that can be played by everyone in chat on your stream! Connect your twitch account and add the resulting URL as a full screen browser source. 1280 x 720 (720p), 1920 x 1080 (1080p), 2560 x 1440 (1440p), 3840 x 2160 (4k) will all work.

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL from the address bar after you connect your Twitch!

Check the top left corner for your handy stream config menu ;)

A 1920x1080 browser source works great! For smoother operation - Enable hardware acceleration for your browser sources in OBS! (Settings>Advanced>Sources)
