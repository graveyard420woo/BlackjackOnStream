<h2>Blackjack On Stream</h2><h3> by graveyard420woo</h3>

This is an interactive Blackjack overlay for Twitch that can be played by everyone in chat on your stream! ;)

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL from the address bar after connecting your Twitch!

A 1920x1080 browser source works great! For smoother operation - Enable hardware acceleration for your browser sources in OBS! (Settings>Advanced>Sources)

<h3>Commands</h3>
<ul>
 <li>!join</li>
 <li>!leave</li>
 <li>!hit</li>
 <li>!stand</li>
</ul>

I am a humble artist/tech/streamer. if you would like to suggest edits, please do! I hope you enjoy this game with your friends! (;
