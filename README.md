<h2>Blackjack On Stream</h2><h3> by graveyard420woo</h3>

Blackjack On Stream is an interactive overlay for Twitch that can be played by everyone in chat on your stream! Connect your twitch account and add the resulting URL as a full screen browser source. 1280 x 720 (720p), 1920 x 1080 (1080p), 2560 x 1440 (1440p), 3840 x 2160 (4k) will all work.

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL from the address bar after you connect your Twitch!

Check the top left corner for your handy stream config menu ;)

A 1920x1080 browser source works great! For smoother operation - Enable hardware acceleration for your browser sources in OBS! (Settings>Advanced>Sources)

<h3>Commands</h3>
<ul>
 <li><strong>!join</strong></li>
 <li><strong>!leave</strong></li>
 <li><strong>!hit</strong> (!hitme !h)</li>
 <li><strong>!stand</strong> (!stay !s)</li>
 <li><strong>!doubledown</strong> (!dd)</li>
 <li><strong>!split</strong> (then hit or stay on each hand)</li>
 <li><strong>!bet</strong> [amount]</li>
 <li>Look out for <strong>!buy</strong> items! <br>Emotes will be drawn in from your connected twitch channel and added to the buy items pool in addition to some other emoji and emotes.. (; See how many you and your chatters can collect!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Command exclamation points (!) are always optional. Players may simply type join or hit or h or dd etc...</li>
 <li>Click the dealer's chip icon and drag to position the dealer anywhere you like on screen</li>
 <li>Currently, players are not allowed to spend all of their chips on buy items because then they would have zero and be kicked right away. so if you have 90 chips and a buy item is 90 you must have at least 91 chips to buy it</li>
</ul>

I am your humble artist/tech/streamer. if you would like to suggest edits, please do! I hope you enjoy this game with your friends in chat! (; 

This thing is a labor of love..
